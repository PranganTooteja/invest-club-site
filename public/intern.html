                <h5 class="subsection">Overview</h5>
                <p>The Berkeley Investment Group offers a semester-long internship as a means of training exceptional students to become analysts. It's ambitious. Why? Because the program is in-depth and very fast-paced with different topics within finance being introduced every single week. Applications go out typically at the beginning of each semester after our first info session. Applicants are required to write up a stock pitch with heavy emphasis given on both the creativity of their ideas and validity of their <i>variant perception</i>, or how the analysis differs from what "The Street" is thinking. Upon passing the initial screening, the candidates are then invited to present their pitch to a panel comprising of current BIG officers. The 12-15 interns finally selected are expected to attend a weekend class taught by BIG's dedicated intern directors, participate in the general-member meetings, and complete weekly deliverables. The average intern spends <strong> 10-15 hours </strong> a week on material.

           <div class ="involved-section">
             <h5 class="subsection">How to Approach the Written Application</h5>
             <p>The first part of our recruitment process is a written application. The applications is your chance to share your interests as well as a stock pitch. A few key qualities that successful interns of previous semesters have shown include:

              <br><b>Curiosity</b>: When an investor is doing research, the majority of this is learning how businesses serve evolving market needs. Our best interns have an innate desire to learn about and predict evolving market trends in the world and how these intersect to impact a company’s performance. There are a variety of ways our applicants have shown this in previous years. For example, some applicants have discussed extracurriculars in which they have participated where research is a key component, such as debate, or centered their pitch around their other interests, such as beauty products or video games.
              <br><b>Analytical Mindset</b>: While we have the intern program to teach you about how to build a strong investment research process, it is harder to teach the analytical mindset that is needed to synthesize all the information one collects and its implications when deciding whether or not a company is a viable investment. That is why we highly value those who demonstrate such capabilities. This is best shown in the stock-pitch by expressing a logically and independently constructed thesis. We specifically ask for a ‘variant perception’ portion in the stock-pitch. This is where you can directly explain the areas where the results of your critical analysis differ from others and the reasons why you believe the available data best supports your narrative.
              </p>
             <h5 class="subsection">Stock Pitch</h5>
             <p>It is important to note that we are not judging candidates on the “correctness” of their pitch, we understand most candidates are only beginning to look investments and may not have thorough investment research processes. The purpose of the written stock pitch is primarily as a judge of your analytical capabilities and effort put towards critical thinking. We also do not require applicants to use technical finance terms in their application.</p>
             <h5 class="subsection">Example Stock Pitch</h5>
             <p>What company are you presenting and is it a long (buy) or short (sell)?
              <br>CBOE, Long<br>

              <br>What does the company do and how does it make money?
              <br>The company operates various security exchanges both in the United States and globally. It’s proprietary products include options on market indexes such as the S&P 500, exchange-traded products (ETPs), and the volatility index futures (VIX). The company earns transaction fee spreads for every trade executed on its platform. It also charges customers for market data and connectivity to its platform. Other less important sources of revenue include listing fees and software fees.
              <br>
              <br>What are relevant industry trends and how are they impacting the company?
              <br>Low revenue growth (~5%) can be expected to continue in future years with continued increased preference of investors to ETPs due to passive investing growth as well as more sophisticated financial products, like options and VIX futures.
              <br>
              <br>What are the company's competitive strengths?
              <br>The biggest attraction for traders to an exchange is having a wide variety of tradable securities and a high volume for each security. Listers will also prefer markets with high volume as it indicates that the right buyers for the security are present on the exchange. Once an exchange establishes itself as a leader for certain securities they are able to easily dominate a space due to this. This is effectively a network effect. CBOE is dominant in the options space, volatility futures, and European equities. It also has a major presence in ETPs and foreign exchange markets.
              <br>
              <br>What is your variant perception?
              <br>CBOE has seen lower volume in VIX futures due to issues it faced a few months ago. Credit Suisse had an inverse volatility product that was liquidated after it fell down about 90% in a day during February 2018. This product was a major contributor to VIX volumes. Largely due to this, VIX futures volumes as a whole have reduced by about 20% on average since February. This is worrying as VIX futures were one of CBOE’s fastest growing categories, and any permanent impact from this event would significantly impact the future outlook of this company from an investor perspective. In addition, lawsuits related to the methodology used to calculate VIX have been initiated.
              CBOE’s VIX product suite remains the best way to trade volatility in the market. Even after the drop in volume, it continues to provide the greatest variety of products and highest volumes for traders as it is the pioneer of this field and benefited from network effects historically. This will not change due to this one event, as evidenced by VIX futures volume stabilizing at these lower levels with some products beginning to show slight growth from these levels. In the long-term, VIX volumes will pick-up again as new strategies are developed with investors now more cognizant of the risks associated with these products. In fact, the increase in media coverage could encourage higher volumes in the long run. CBOE has also taken steps and addressed the issues outlined in these lawsuits, and these should not prove .
              <br>
              </p>
             <h5 class="subsection">How to approach the first interview</h5>
             <p>The second stage of our interview process is a meeting with members of BIG’s application committee where you get the chance to present your stock pitch and respond to questions we may have. Having gotten to this stage, we believe that your written pitch was extremely promising! Here we are trying to see how well you would fit into our intern class, particularly looking for the following:

              <br><b>Confidence</b>: As a club we make all investment decisions collectively, with every officer having the chance to express their opinion and vote. We are looking for candidates who we believe will be active in this process if they become officers, not afraid to share their opinions on the quality of an investment proposal and, also, willing to constructively learn from feedback. This quality is also critical throughout the intern program, where all interns are invited to share their ideas weekly in open discussions so that interns can learn from each other.
              <br><b>Cohesion</b>: Being able to express your thoughts vocally, prioritizing your key points, demonstrates that you have a deep understanding of what you are presenting.
              </p>
             <h5 class="subsection">What Makes our Application Process Different</h5>
             <p>We mean it when we say that we truly consider every applicant. If you follow the above advice, demonstrating that you have the skills that we want in our interns, we believe that every applicant stands a good chance of making the intern program. Part of this is because our class size and make-up is flexible unlike many clubs, meaning that we don’t have artificial constraints that limit our ability to include candidates that we believe deserve a chance to learn from the intern program. Additionally we do not favor students from certain majors as we value having a wide range of perspectives represented in our club.

            <h3 class="section-title">Intern Program FAQ</h3>
            <div class="involved-section">
                <h5 class="subsection">When can I apply? Why is there no application currently availible?</h5>
                <p>Our application is typically only open in a two week window during the first month of the semester. For example, in the Fall 2017 semester, our application period ran from 8/30 - 9/7.</p>
                <h5 class="subsection">What do I have to do for the application?</h5>
                <p>While the application varies semester to semester, the focal point is a stock pitch. We expect our applicants to qualitatively pitch us a long or a short on a publically traded company.</p>
                <h5 class="subsection">Do I need investing experience to apply?</h5>
                <p>No! Some of our most successful interns have started off with little to no investing knowledge. In the stock pitch portion of the application we are looking more for researching and critical thinking skills rather than technical knowledge.</p>
                <h5 class="subsection">Why do I have to pay the general member fee?</h5>
                <p>We require all officers to be general members since we expect them to be active participants in the program. We expect applicants to also be members because it shows that they are committed to participating to the club in some capacity. It also provides people who don't get accepted to the intern program another outlet to involve themselves in our community!</p>
