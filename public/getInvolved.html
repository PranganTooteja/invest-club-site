                <p>General Membership is your best way to utilize our resources and find out what we're all about.
                We organize weekly Thursday meetings that include equity pitches, educational presentations and opportunities to meet industry professionals in all facets of finance. In addition, members have the opportunity to invest in our fund, access exclusive (not on the website) resources such as finance interview guides, books, and older pitches.

                Practical finance skills are so important and the best way to learn is with others. Throughout the semester, we hold several value investing tutorials, along with financial modeling workshops. Members will have the opportunity to build financial models from ground up with hands-on guidance from Officers.

                The Berkeley Investment Group Membership aims to introduce students new to investing in an interactive fashion. This is the first step to joining our community: <a href="pay.html">become a member.</a></p>

                <h3 class="section-title">Intro to Investing</h3>
                <p>The Intro to Investing DeCal is taught by BIG officers Wednesdays 7-9pm and offers a perfect avenue for relative novices to learn more about investment. The class starts with the basics of analyzing a company and lectures on how the market works, and gradually progresses to simple modeling by the end of the semester. By the end of the course, every student will be able to formulate and support their own investment theses. This is a great place to start for new members who hope to later proceed to the intern program. The top performers automatically get an interview.

                <h5 class="subsection">Overview</h5>
                <p>The Berkeley Investment Group, at its core, is a mutual fund that has $130,000 student raised and managed AUM. Analysts, also known as officers, are a group of around 40 students who devote 5-10 hours a week actively monitoring the fund's long/short equity holdings, generating ideas for new positions, and supporting BIG's various educational and professional community events. To become an analyst, each officer spent a semester involved in the club's <a href = "intern.html"> intern program</a>, a comprehensive course that allows new students to gain the skills and understanding needed to manage a fund.
